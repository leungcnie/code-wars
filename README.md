Collection of katas I've personally worked through provided by the educational community platform [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/).

## Learning Notes
JavaScript
* Use [RegExp](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_regexp.asp) to replace characters in a string
* You can use [lastIndexOf()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/lastIndexOf) for duplicates questions (e.g. current index of "e" should equal the last index of "e" in a word if it's not a duplicate)
